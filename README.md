# Nep-Language
A simple translator for Neppy Language...

Usage: Currently you can input the string you wish to translate, and press enter. It will perform one translation into Neppy language
and one translation back. You may easily modify the program's  `main()` function to allow more complicated use like translating Neptune
language back directly.

The program is written in 2hrs and may have flaws like not converting commas into periods at the end of text if no extra bits are available.
Fixes are simple but not carried out in the current version.

Any help in improving or adding features is welcome.
